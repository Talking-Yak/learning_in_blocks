Regarding interactive communication, I initially rated it 2, but Peer C's point about the user being generally understood despite some errors is valid. The user does engage in the conversation, though with some difficulty, so a score of 2 is reasonable.

Agent C's point about the meaning being generally understood despite errors is valid, but the interactive communication score remains at 2 because the user still required prompting and support, and errors occasionally hindered clarity. Agent B's observation about weak word choice, such as 'accounts for my daytoday life' and 'etc.', is accurate and supports my initial vocabulary score of 1.

However, these errors are minor and do not significantly impede the overall meaning. The student was able to convey their message clearly and effectively in all exchanges. Regarding vocabulary, while some word choices could be more specific, the student used appropriate terms for everyday banking topics, which aligns with A2 level expectations. Interactive communication remains strong, as the student engaged in the conversation without much prompting. I maintain that the initial assessment was reasonable, as the student's overall performance meets the Band 3 (Passing Standard) criteria, with some elements aligning with Band 4.""

However, I still believe that the user's interactive communication is passable but shows hesitation and lacks fluency, as noted in my initial assessment. I have adjusted my grammar score to 2 to reflect that while there are errors, they are not pervasive or severe enough to warrant a score of 1. Vocabulary remains at 3, as the errors are present but not extreme. Interactive communication is still at 3, as the user requires some prompting and shows limited fluency.""

  ""rationale"": ""After reviewing my peers' assessments, I acknowledge that Agent A identified some grammatical issues, such as 'I don't meet them a very long time' and 'I am planning to visit my family's and attending wedding celebration there,' which I initially overlooked. However, these errors are relatively minor and do not significantly impede understanding. I maintain that the grammar is mostly correct and at an A2 level, so I will not lower the grammar score. Agent C’s argument that the meaning was clear despite some grammatical imprecision is valid, and I agree that the interactive communication is functional and not severely hindered. However, I still believe the vocabulary score should remain low due to the use of imprecise terms such as 'family's,' 'attending wedding celebration,' 'entire duration,' 'wellknown,' and 'different places,' which are not appropriate for an A2 learner. These word choices reflect a lexical gap and suggest a need for more precise vocabulary. I will maintain my original scores and rationale with a slight adjustment to acknowledge that some grammatical issues are present but not severe enough to justify a lower score.""

However, I still believe that the user's vocabulary is sufficient for basic communication at A2 level, even if not optimal. Regarding interactive communication, while the user was able to maintain exchanges, the frequency of errors and imprecise language did create some friction, which justifies a score of 2 rather than 3.

Peer C's argument about interactive communication is partially valid—there is some engagement—but the responses are often brief, repetitive, or unclear, which suggests the user still requires prompting and support. Peer C's emphasis on 'communicative success' is accurate, but it doesn't fully account for the limitations in vocabulary and grammar. The user's lexical choices, such as 'good,' 'yeah,' 'okay,' and 'thing,' are indeed generic and lack the precision expected at A2 level. The misuse of 'Google Play' instead of 'Google Pay' and 'bark account' instead of 'bank account' further supports the vocabulary score of 2.

Regarding vocabulary, I agree that the student used appropriate terms related to the topic, but the vague phrasing in Exchange 16 ('different way they need work before') does indicate some lexical imprecision, so a score of 3 is reasonable.

Peer C's argument that the meaning was clear despite minor errors is valid, and I agree that the interactive communication remains strong, as the student was able to maintain exchanges effectively. The vocabulary score remains at 3 because of the occasional imprecise phrasing, such as 'different way they need work before' instead of 'different Wi-Fi network,' which reflects a lexical gap.

Peer B's point about vocabulary being slightly imprecise in Exchange 16 is valid, but the overall vocabulary used was appropriate for the topic.

For instance, the user's 'Samsung is good, my sister has one' has a minor subject-verb agreement issue, but the overall meaning is clear and the sentence is understandable. Similarly, in 'I want earphone under 15,000,' the error is minor and does not impede comprehension. I also recognize that while the vocabulary is not always precise (e.g., 'thing' instead of 'phone,' 'colors' instead of 'colours'), it is still appropriate for an A2 learner and functional in the context of the conversation. Regarding interactive communication, I maintain that the user's responses are clear and understandable, though they lack some depth and variety, which aligns with Band 3. Therefore, I have adjusted my scores accordingly, lowering the grammar and vocabulary scores slightly and maintaining the interactive communication score.""

Regarding vocabulary, I maintain my original assessment that the student uses generic terms like 'good' and 'thing,' which suggest limited lexical precision for an A2 learner.

In Exchange 8, 'are submit' is clearly incorrect, but 'are submitted' is a minor correction. I also recognize that my vocabulary score was too high, as the user often used generic terms like 'loan' without specific context, which aligns with Peer B's point about limited lexical precision.

In Exchange 3, 'for saving' should be 'for saving money' to match the corrected version, but the original lacks the necessary preposition or phrase. In Exchange 5, 'which produces' should be 'that produces' for relative pronoun usage. In Exchange 8, 'want saving accounts' lacks the correct plural form 'savings accounts'.

In Exchange 5, 'which produces' is a minor relative pronoun error, but the meaning is clear. I also recognize that some of the vocabulary issues, such as 'saving' instead of 'savings' or 'good interest rates' instead of 'high interest rates,' are common at A2 and do not necessarily reflect a lack of vocabulary control, but rather a limited range of precise lexical choices. However, I still believe the grammar score should remain at 2, as there are multiple instances of tense and article misuse that indicate limited control.

This aligns with a score of 2 for vocabulary. As for interactive communication, while the student responds appropriately and engages in the conversation, there are moments where they require prompting (e.g., in Exchange 6 and 7), which justifies a score of 3.

  ""rationale"": ""After reviewing the peer assessments, I acknowledge that some of my initial grammar evaluations were overly strict, particularly in cases where the meaning was clear despite minor errors. For example, in Exchange 5, the student's attempt to express difficulty in finding the right word was understandable, and in Exchange 12, the student politely requested to end the conversation, which shows some pragmatic awareness. However, the student still demonstrates very limited grammatical control, with recurring issues in word order, prepositions, and sentence structure that prevent them from meeting even the Band 3 standard. While the vocabulary is somewhat appropriate for the topic, it lacks precision and is often vague, which justifies a lower vocabulary score. The interactive communication is limited, with frequent hesitations and an attempt to end the conversation prematurely, which aligns with Band 2 rather than Band 3. I maintain that the student's grammar is at Band 1, and the overall performance is below the passing standard.""

Agent C's assessment highlights that the student effectively conveys meaning despite some errors, which aligns with my view that interactive communication is generally good, though with some hesitation. The student's attempt to politely end the conversation in Exchange 12 shows awareness of interaction norms, which supports my original score for interactive communication. Regarding vocabulary, while there are instances of less precise word choices (e.g., 'designs' instead of 'patterns', 'colorful' instead of 'vibrant'), the student uses appropriate vocabulary for the topic, so I do not believe this warrants a change in the vocabulary score.""

Peer C's point about the meaning being clear despite errors is valid, and I now see that my initial assessment of interactive communication was slightly too harsh. I also consider Peer B's observation about vocabulary being slightly generic in places, such as 'very good color scheme' instead of more precise terms like 'color palette.' While the vocabulary is generally appropriate, there is room for improvement in word choice.

However, I still believe that the user's overall communication remains largely clear and functional, with minimal prompting required, which supports maintaining the interactive communication score at 4. Regarding vocabulary, while there are some weak word choices (e.g., 'very good color scheme'), the user generally uses appropriate vocabulary for an A2 level, so I do not feel the need to lower the vocabulary score.

There were some grammatical errors, such as 'What kind of details needed for create a bank account?' which was corrected to 'What kind of details are needed to create a bank account?' However, these were minor and did not prevent understanding.

Regarding vocabulary, I agree with Peer B that the word choices were basic and lacked precision, which supports a lower vocabulary score.

For instance, while there are clear grammatical errors such as 'I don't know the difference' (which should be 'I don't know the difference'), and 'I do not interested' (which should be 'I am not interested'), these are common at A2 level and do not necessarily indicate a complete lack of control over basic structures. I also recognize that Agent C's point about the meaning being clear despite errors is valid—this suggests that the interactive communication score may have been too low.

However, the errors are not severe and do not impede understanding, which supports my original view that the user demonstrates sufficient grammatical control at A2 level. Regarding vocabulary, Peer B's point about the use of generic terms like 'account' instead of 'savings account' is valid, but the user does use appropriate terms in several instances (e.g., 'Aadhaar card,' 'PAN card'), so I maintain the vocabulary score of 3. Interactive communication remains strong, as the user engages in the conversation, responds appropriately, and maintains the dialogue, which justifies the score of 4.

Peer B's observation about vocabulary is also relevant; the user's word choice, such as 'benefits' instead of 'interest rate' and 'online blanking' instead of 'online banking,' shows some lexical imprecision, which affects the vocabulary score.

Therefore, I maintain a moderate score for interactive communication but adjust the vocabulary score downward based on Peer B's observation.""

  ""rationale"": ""While Peer A correctly identified several grammatical errors, such as incorrect tense in 'I had' vs. 'I have' and incorrect word order in 'I use mostly Google Pay transaction,' these errors are relatively minor and do not significantly hinder comprehension. The user's overall ability to maintain simple exchanges and convey intent is consistent with A2 level, as noted by Peer C. However, the user's vocabulary remains limited, using generic terms like 'good' and 'thing' instead of more specific banking-related terms, which aligns with my original assessment. I maintain that the interactive communication score is appropriate, as the user generally participates in the conversation without significant hesitation. The feedback from Peer C is valid in noting that the meaning was clear, but I still believe the vocabulary needs improvement for an A2 level.""

However, there are several instances of generic or vague vocabulary, such as 'saving account' (should be 'savings account'), 'online banking service' (should be 'online banking services'), 'address proof' (a correct term, but 'ID proof' is also acceptable), and 'cash' (a correct term, but could have been more precise by using 'cash deposit' or 'cash transaction'). The student also uses 'thing' or 'stuff' in some contexts, though not in this transcript. Overall, vocabulary is limited in precision and range, and grammar is mostly correct but not flawless.

Peer B correctly pointed out several grammatical issues such as 'saving' instead of 'savings,' 'aadhar' instead of 'Aadhar,' and 'because for' instead of 'because of.' These are clear errors that indicate limited control over grammatical structures, but not entirely absent. I will lower the grammar score from 1 to 2 to reflect this more accurately.

Peer B also noted that vocabulary is limited in precision, which I agree with—terms like 'saving account' and 'online banking service' show a lack of lexical accuracy. I will adjust the vocabulary score from 3 to 2 accordingly.

Regarding interactive communication, Peer C argues that the student's meaning was clear despite errors, and that the communication was effective and maintained the flow of conversation. While I initially rated it 3, I now recognize that the student required some prompting and had difficulty maintaining fluidity. I will maintain the interactive communication score at 3, as the student was able to participate in simple exchanges, though not entirely independently.""","{

However, I still believe the grammar errors are not so severe as to warrant a score lower than 2.
