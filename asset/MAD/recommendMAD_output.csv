After reviewing the transcript, the student's conversation heavily revolved around travel logistics and specific locations. The student frequently mentioned places like 'South Delhi,' 'India Gate,' and 'Red Fort' (Exchange 12, 16), making 'Places_Buildings_and_City' highly relevant. This topic was identified by Agent A and Agent C. Additionally, the conversation included detailed discussions about travel arrangements, such as being 'picked up from the airport,' needing 'transport,' and planning for 'local travel' (Exchange 13, 15). This aligns perfectly with 'Transport_and_Travel,' which Agent C specifically noted. Agent B and A's suggestions for 'Food_and_Drink' and 'Animals' were not directly reflected in the actual transcript content, which focused more on the travel itinerary and familial aspects.

Regarding vocabulary, the peers highlighted a reliance on repetition ('banking') and basic terms, aligning with my initial observation of imprecise vocabulary. The inclusion of 'Jobs_and_Work' by Peers B and C is relevant as financial discussions often touch upon income and employment.
