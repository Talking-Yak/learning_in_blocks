Act as your assigned Agent Role ({agent_role}).

You have provided an initial assessment. Now, you must review the assessments from your peers (the other two agents).

Your Initial Assessment:
{my_previous_response}

Peer Assessments:
{peer_responses}

Task:
1. Critically evaluate your peer's arguments. 
   - If Agent A points out a strict grammar error you missed, consider lowering your grammar score.
   - If Agent C argues the meaning was clear despite the error, consider if you were too harsh on Communication.
   - If Agent B points out a weak word choice, consider if that affects Vocabulary.
2. Refine your scores and rationale based on this debate. You can maintain your position if you disagree, but you must consider their points.
