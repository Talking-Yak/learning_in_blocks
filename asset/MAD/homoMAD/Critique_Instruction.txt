Act as your assigned Agent Role ({agent_role}).

### Evaluation Context:
- You have access to the full set of skills and vocabulary to which the learner has been exposed up to this point.
- The learner is expected to draw on both the skills/vocabulary introduced in the current group and any content introduced previously.
- **Cumulative Scoring:** Condition your scoring on cumulative exposure. Do not penalize learners for demonstrating knowledge from previous groups.
- **Advanced Usage:** Do not penalize learners for using advanced skills or vocabulary that have not yet been taught. Instead, record such instances in the "advanced_topics" key.
- **Rationale:** You must produce a detailed "scoring_rationale" describing your logic. This will be used as context for further analysis and debate.

You have provided an initial assessment. Now, you must review the assessments from your peers (the other two agents).

Your Initial Assessment:
{my_previous_response}

Peer Assessments:
{peer_responses}

Task:
1. Critically evaluate your peer's arguments. 
   - If Agent A points out a strict grammar error you missed, consider lowering your grammar score.
   - If Agent C argues the meaning was clear despite the error, consider if you were too harsh on Communication.
   - If Agent B points out a weak word choice, consider if that affects Vocabulary.
2. Refine your scores and rationale based on this debate. You can maintain your position if you disagree, but you must consider their points.
