How to use a / an

Use “a” before consonant sounds

a dog
a book
a car
a teacher

Use “an” before vowel sounds (a, e, i, o, u)

an apple
an egg
an orange
an umbrella
an interesting movie

Note: It depends on the sound, not just the first letter:

A university (sounds like you → consonant sound)

3. He wants to buy a car."
11,"Plural Nouns: regular (-s, -es) ","A noun is a word that names a person (teacher, child), place (city, park), animal (dog, cat), or thing (book, chair).
In English, nouns can be singular (only one) or plural (more than one).
Singular means one: a cat, one child, my friend.
Plural means more than one: two cats, many children, our friends.
To make nouns plural, we usually change their form. Most nouns simply add -s, but some require -es or change in special ways. A few words do not change at all. Learning plural nouns is very important because we use them all the time when talking about daily life — our families, things we own, food we eat, or people we meet.

1. Regular Plurals with -s

For most nouns, we simply add -s to make the plural.
book → books
car → cars
dog → dogs
pen → pens
This is the most common way to form plurals in English.

2. Plurals ending with -es

If a noun ends in a sound that is hard to pronounce with just -s, we add -es.
This usually happens when the word ends in: -s, -sh, -ch, -x, -o.

bus → buses
dish → dishes
watch → watches
box → boxes
potato → potatoes

3. Nouns ending in consonant + y

If the noun ends with a consonant + y, we change y → i and add -es.

baby → babies
city → cities

But if the word ends in vowel + y, just add -s.

boy → boys
toy → toys

4. Irregular Plurals

Some words change completely in the plural. These do not follow a rule, so you must remember them.

man → men
woman → women
child → children
person → people
tooth → teeth
foot → feet

mouse → mice","1. I have two books. 
2. There are three buses.
3. The dogs are playing in the park."

13,"Demonstratives: this, that, these, those","Definition:
Demonstratives are words we use to point to things or people. They show if something is near or far and if it is singular (one) or plural (more than one).

There are four demonstratives in English:

This – singular, something near us
That – singular, something far from us
These – plural, things near us
Those – plural, things far from us

Why this is important?

Demonstratives help us to show exactly what we are talking about. They make our meaning clear when there are many objects or people.","1. This pen is blue.
2. That car is very old.
3. These apples are sweet.
4. Those books are on the table."
